Null404 is looking for a way to both schedule notifications to be published on a discord channel, as well as automatically create notifications based on events that are on the calendar. 

- Scheduled Notifications:
   - A moderator(who has a specific Discord Role assigned to them) should be able to use a Discord /slash command to write up the notification and set when to send the notification
   - Images/attachments should be supported as well
- Automatic Event Notifications:
   - Using a Discord /slash command, a moderator(who has a specific Discord Role assigned to them) should be able to run something like /generate-event-notifications and using AI like chatgpt should automatically come up with with messages that will be scheduled the  afternoon before, and the  afternoon of our the event at 12pm PST. The user could then review the changes, and then then give a command to accept the messages, other wise they can use a command to make edits
      - Areas to investigate:
         - Cheap or Free AI options
